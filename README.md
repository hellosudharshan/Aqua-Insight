###Problem Statement
The world is facing a growing need for clean water. This issue is compounded by challenges like water wastage, contamination, and imbalances in pH and mineral levels. In India, there's a significant problem with water leakage and unsupervised water distribution, which leads to a substantial amount of water wastage. These issues are not only environmental but also major causes of health problems. While traditional water quality assessment methods are prone to error and time-consuming, there is a clear need for advanced, real-time monitoring systems. The lack of proper water tariff policies and a fragmented approach to water management also contributes to customer dissatisfaction and water loss from old, worn-out pipelines.

###Proposed Solution
AquaInsight is a GIS-based tool designed to map, monitor, and manage water supply networks. It is a data-driven system that uses advanced sensor technologies for comprehensive water collection, monitoring, and analysis. By embedding technology into water management, AquaInsight aims to enhance water sustainability, safeguard public health, and provide data-driven insights. The system's primary objective is to reduce water wastage and optimize water usage by analyzing water quality and mineral content. This innovative platform promises to enhance water management through a user-friendly interface that is accessible on web and mobile platforms.

###Key Features
•	GIS-based Mapping: The tool visualizes water supply network components through an interactive map with customizable layers. This helps identify critical pollution hotspots and optimize water resource management.
•	Real-Time Monitoring: The system integrates IoT sensors (water flow, TDS, turbidity sensors) for real-time monitoring and leak detection. This allows for the rapid detection of issues and automated responses.
•	User-Friendly Interface: The tool ensures accessibility for all stakeholders with an intuitive interface and a robust search function.
•	Alerts and Notifications: The system provides role-specific alerts for anomalies, such as leaks or contamination, to relevant stakeholders.
•	Communication Hub: AquaInsight integrates a communication hub to facilitate collaboration and emergency response among stakeholders.
•	Predictive Maintenance: The system supports predictive maintenance by analyzing historical data to identify potential issues before they occur.
•	Water Quality Monitoring: It continuously monitors and analyzes water quality parameters to track pollutants and evaluate changes over time.
•	Trend Analysis: The analytics dashboard uses a secure database to store historical data, supporting trend analysis for resource allocation and informed decision-making.
